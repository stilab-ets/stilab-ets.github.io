#### Member Creation

The admins can create a member <u>not</u> associated with a registered user. This mean, the member created can not login with the information used for the creation.

The purpose of this form is to associate possible external members without them needing to create an account. If they want to properly register an account later, the admin can delete the old member and edit, for exemple, a publication to associate the correct member.
